# How to contribute
- Fork the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- [Contact me first](http://ruben.verborgh.org/) if you plan to implement a larger feature, as I might have specific ideas on how this is done best.
- Each feature must be accompanied by a test.
- Each commit must pass all tests.
- Each commit should be a meaningful logical unit; clean-up comments such as “fixing typo” should be amended to the relevant commit.
- Write commit messages in the present tense and end them with a dot.
- [Code beautifully.](http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2013/02/21/programming-is-an-art/)
